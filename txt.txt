1.What is OOP? List OOP concepts.
-->Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.
*oops concepts.
1.Class
2.Objects
3.Encapsulation
4.Abstraction
5.Polymorphism
6.Inheritance
7.Dynamic Binding
8.Message Passing

2.What is the difference between OOP and POP? 
Parameter	Object Oriented Programming(OOP)	                                  Procedure Oriented Programming(POP)
Definition	1.OOP refers to Object Oriented Programming.                               1.POP refers to Procedural Oriented Programming and deals 
                It deals with objects and their properties.                                  with programs and functions. 
Approach	2.An object-oriented program uses the bottom-up approach.                  2.A procedure-oriented program uses the top-down approach.
Access Control	3.Access control is supported by the means of access modifiers.            3.No access modifiers are supported. 
                The access specifiers such as public, private and protected are 
                used.
Data Hiding	4.Data can be hidden using encapsulation.                                  4.There is no data-hiding mechanism. Data is globally accessible, 
                                                                                             as there are no access specifiers.   
Entity Linkage	5.Object functions are linked through message passing.                     5.Parameter passing is involved in message passing.
Polymorphism	6.Method overloading and method overriding are used in OOP to              6.POP does not support polymorphism.
                achieve polymorphism.   
Code Reuse	7.OOP supports code reusability.	                                   7.No code reusability is provided by POP.    
Operator        8.It is allowed in OOP. 	                                           8.Operator overloading is not allowed in POP.
Overloading
